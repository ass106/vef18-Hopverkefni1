    =============== REMOTE =============

    git clone remote_location clone_name 
    // remote_location can be web address or filepath
    // remote address is given the name origin
    // clone_name is the name you give to the dir in which git will clone

    git remote -v
    // get list of remotes

    git fetch
    // see if changes have been made to the remote, brings the changes down
    // to your local copy.
    // this does NOT merge changes from the remote into your local repo
    // It brings those changes onto what's called a remote branch

    git merge origin/master
    // integrate origin/master into your local master

    git push origin branch_name
    // push your branch up to the remote, origin
